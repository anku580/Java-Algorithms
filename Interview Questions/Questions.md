# This file is all about the interview question asked in java.
Keep on adding the interview questions.


### Q1 - Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java.
A1- 
> main() in Java is the entry point for any Java program. It is always written as public static void main(String[] args).
  * public: Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.
  * static: It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class-based. main() is made static in Java so that it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class. In case, main is not made static then the compiler will throw an error as main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made and only static methods can be directly invoked via the class. 
  * void: It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not returnss any value.
  * main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occurs.
  * String args[]: It is the parameter passed to the main method.
  
  ### Q2 - Is java Pass by value or Pass by reference?
A2- 
> Java is strictly Pass by Value. This can be best explained by a swap() function in java.
```java
public static void swap(int n1, int n2)
{
    int temp=n1;
    n1=n2;
    n2=temp;
}

public static void main(String[] args)
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    swap(a,b);
    System.out.print(a,b);
    
    //output will be 10 20
}
```

### Q3- Can we declare the main method of our class as private?

A3- 
> In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error. 

### Q4- Is there any way to skip Finally block of exception even if some exception occurs in the exception block?

A4-
> If an exception is raised in `Try` block, control passes to `catch` block if it exists otherwise to finally block. `Finally` block is always executed when an exception occurs and the only way to avoid execution of any statements in Finally block is by aborting the code forcibly by writing following line of code at the end of try block:

```System.exit(0);```

### Q5- What is System class?

A5-
> System.class is a final class provided by java.lang package. It contains several useful class fields and methods. The purpose of System class is to provide access to system
resources.

### Q6- What is the difference between Singleton class and Static class?

A6- 
 * A static class in Java has only static methods. It is a container of functions. It is created based on procedural programming design. Singleton class is a pattern in Object Oriented Design. 
 * A Singletonclass has only one instance of an object in JVM.  This pattern is
implemented in such a way that there is always only one instance of
that class present in JVM.

### Q7 - What are Wrapper classes in Java?
A7-
> Java has concept of Wrapper classes to allow primitive types to be
accessed as objects. Primitive types like boolean, int, double, float
etc. have corresponding Wrappers classes â€“ Boolean, Integer,
Double, Float etc.
Many of these Wrapper classes are in java.lang package.
Java 5.0 has launched the concept of Autoboxing and Unboxing in
Java for Wrapper classes.
```java
 public class WrapperTest {
            public static void main(String args[]) {
                                                
            int count=50;                                   //Converting int into Integer
            Integer i=Integer.valueOf(count);//converting int into Integer
            Integer j=a;//autoboxing, now compiler will write
            Integer.valueOf(count) internally
            System.out.println(count+" "+i+" "+j);
      }
}
```

### Q8- You have 10 balls and a scale, find the heaviest ball in the least interations.

A8- 
 >  Seperate the balls into two groups of 5 and place each group on the scale.  Take balls from the heaviest side, put 1 on the side and weigh two on each side.  If even, heaviest one is on the side.  If the scale dips weigh those balls.  Least amount of iterations is 3.
 >  It's a logic puzzle to see how you willl troubleshoot through a problem.
